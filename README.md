# CS445 Final Project
## Requirements
- Python3
- Jupyter Notebook
- To run the code, the following python packages are needed: cv2, numpy, random, matplotlib, and scipy.ndimage
## To start
### Global image matching
1. Run Jupyter Notebook
2. Open `global.ipynb`
3. Change the source image and grayscale image if you want
4. Run the notebook
### Swatches matching
1. Run Jupyter Notebook
2. Open `swatches.ipynb`
3. Change the source image and grayscale image if you want
4. Feel free to change the number of swatches in `count = 2`, the default is 2
5. Run the notebook
6. NOTICE: When you choose the swatch, you need to sequentially click on the left-top point and right-bottom point of the swatch you want. After you select swatch, press any key two times to get into next step.
